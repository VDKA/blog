title: About Ethan Jackwitz

I am a Software Engineer in Brisbane, Australia.

# Work

I work at [Tappr](tappr.io) developing products including our iOS POS application.

# Kai Programming Language

I currently spend my spare time developing a language of my own design called Kai.

Kai aims to be a simple low level programming language with a feature set somewhere between C and Go.

Work on Kai began in late 2016 after being inspired by [Jonathan Blow's](twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow) work on [Jai](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO).

The compiler design borrows things I have learnt from the [Go Compiler](github.com/golang/go)
The language itself also borrows on some of Go's ideas and aims to build upon them further [Go](golang.org/ref/spec)

# Speaking

I regularly speak at the Brisbane CocoaHeads where I help organize. Slides from all my talks are available [here](https://github.com/vdka/presentations)
