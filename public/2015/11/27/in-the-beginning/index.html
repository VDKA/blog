        <p>Initialization and configuration can be a tricky topic in Swift. It can be difficult to know where to put things. This leaves plenty of people with stray implicitly unwrapped optionals laying around. Thankfully there can be a couple of neat tricks to tidy up your initialization code.</p>

<p>Implicitly unwrapped optionals are going to feel most familiar to Obj-C developers. These act like pointers insofar as they allow you to declare a property without worrying about setting the property immediately. Implicitly unwrapping an optional is the developer <em>promising</em> you that whenever you access the optional it will never be <code>nil</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">class Method1: Example1 {
	var request: NSURLRequest!

	func setup() { //eg. viewDidLoad
		let request = NSMutableURLRequest()
		request.URL = NSURL(string: &quot;https://api.github.com/users/vdka&quot;)!
		request.cachePolicy = .ReturnCacheDataElseLoad
		request.HTTPMethod = &quot;GET&quot;
		self.request = request
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of problems with this.</p>

<ol>
<li>A developer might expect to be able to access the request from another view controller before initialization in order to do something smart like begin loading the resource during a <code>segue</code>. No problem right, declaring <code>var request: NSURLRequest!</code> you have <em>promised</em> this value would always be set when accessed. Well, it isn&rsquo;t set until we call the <code>setup()</code> method. The typical <em>setup</em> method we see in iOS development is <code>viewDidLoad()</code>. Accessing this request here will cause a crash.</li>
<li>The initialization of the request is completely separate to the declaration. This makes our code less readable.</li>
<li>The request must be declared as a <code>var</code> as you modify it after you initialize it in order to set it up for use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lets look at a way we can address both of these issues.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">class Method2: Example2 {
	var request: NSURLRequest {
		let request = NSMutableURLRequest()
		request.URL = NSURL(string: &quot;https://api.github.com/users/vdka&quot;)!
		request.cachePolicy = .ReturnCacheDataElseLoad
		request.HTTPMethod = &quot;GET&quot;
		return request
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here what we are doing is taking advantage of Swift&rsquo;s <em>computed properties</em> feature. Essentially this is short hand for declaring a property with a getter.</p>

<p>In fact this can be expanded to be of the form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">var request: NSURLRequest {
	get {
		...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>What we have perfectly addresses the issues we had with the previous <code>Method1</code>. The request value is now <em>computed</em> upon request and the initialization code is now a <em>part</em> of the properties declaration.</p>

<p>This is perfect right? Well, not exactly.</p>

<p>So what is wrong with it then?</p>

<p>It is now a computed property. Meaning every time you access the property it is re-computed.</p>

<p>Want to access this request 400 times in a couple seconds? That will really hurt.</p>

<p>This can be seen by adding a count to each bit of configuration code and accessing the properties multiple times.</p>

<p>The real kick is when you realize that accessing the property on the class <code>Method1</code> will only ever call the configuration code once, when you call <code>setup()</code>. So how can we solve this?</p>

<p>Well there is an even swifter way to do this.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">class Method3: Example2 {
	let request: NSURLRequest = {
		let request = NSMutableURLRequest()
		request.URL = NSURL(string: &quot;https://api.github.com/users/vdka&quot;)!
		request.cachePolicy = .ReturnCacheDataElseLoad
		request.HTTPMethod = &quot;GET&quot;
		return request
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach takes advantage of Swift&rsquo;s typing system and closures. The declaration of the request on this class may look like it is a closure type and not a NSURLRequest type (<code>(_) -&gt; NSURLRequest</code>) and well it does. However, because of the closure calling itself after declaration it is actually <em>just</em> the return type.</p>

<p>Thanks to this no longer being a computed property the configuration code will no longer be run upon every call.</p>

<p>Why stop there? To make things even better why not just run the configuration code when it is needed. This can be done as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">class Method4: Example2 {
	private(set) lazy var request: NSURLRequest = {
		let request = NSMutableURLRequest()
		request.URL = NSURL(string: &quot;https://api.github.com/users/vdka&quot;)!
		request.cachePolicy = .ReturnCacheDataElseLoad
		request.HTTPMethod = &quot;GET&quot;
		return request
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note the need to add <code>private(set)</code> in order to maintain immutability to outside classes. I would love to see <code>lazy let</code> be a future feature.</p>
