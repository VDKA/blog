      <description>How this dark theme was generated The code was automatically generated Dark Reader (in this case the safari plugin in dynamic mode). The CSS was then exported on following advice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet cleaned the generated CSS at all.</description>

      <description>Do Not Touch System Headers But if you do it&amp;rsquo;s ok Editing system headers can provide the most mind boggling errors imaginable. Especially if what you edit a macro.
I reconfirmed this while playing around with the definition of the NS_ENUM macro in CoreFoundation. I deleted it, got distracted and left the header file without thinking about it any further. Then suddenly I nothing would build for me.
It took me probably 15 minutes before remembering I was playing around in system headers.</description>

The issue comes when a user would expect to be able to toggle the permission on and go straight back to where they were.</description>
